# Todo With IndexedDB

Simple ToDo application built using React for a hiring project.

## Setup

- Clone repo: `git clone git@github.com:scottwarren/todo.git`
- Install dependencies: `yarn install`
- Run the local server: `yarn start`

### Notes

- Built and tested with Node v14 -- use `nvm use` to set your version of Node to the same version (assuming you have NVM installed)
- Bootstrapped with Create React App with TypeScript
- Using TailwindCSS to quickly build something that looks polished, and modified the default CRA installation according to the [TailwindCSS installation instructions](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app)
